Actual software has been worked by RicardoLameiro. He is using Python. Here is some images:

First Screen. Comes clean after that you press the scan button and...

here they are, the serial port that are available. next you choose a port and then a command.

now as can you see, the dummy command button is pressed(waiting for the response of the hardware).
Since there is no hardware yet :) (at least not in my home the result comes like the following

Here you see the error message!

### To be clear, the final version of the software will not need to choose a working bicycleledpov hardware, since the FirmwareApi should implement an auto identification routine that will identify the hardware freeing the user to know which port to use. ###

The latest software version is always [available on SVN](http://code.google.com/p/bicycleledpov/source/browse/trunk/Software/).
