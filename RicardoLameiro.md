A little about me.

# Introduction #

Hi everyone. My name is Ricardo Lameiro. I am a musician (I play the Bassoon).
I am a friend and former high school colleague of [jpCasainho](http://code.google.com/p/bicycleledpov/wiki/JpCasainho), where I also studied electronics. I love the electronic gadgets and love more to understand it, even make it :), But for now I am giving my extra time to the software programming learning. At this point I am a [Python](http://www.python.org) newbie, so excuse me some bad code, lease help me if you like, i would preciate that.



### in bullets ###

  * I love all the music, but of good quality (I know it depends of my taste)
  * I like everything related to new technologies
  * I am a big fan of the open source / FOSS movements
  * I like to play with microcontrollers, mostly PICmicro

for now it is enough, if something comes to me later I will add it :)
