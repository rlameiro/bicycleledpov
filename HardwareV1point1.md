# Introduction #

This wiki will detail and track the changes made to the hardware from version 1.0 to version 1.1.

Currently work has not begun, but in the hardware upgrade, we hope to accomplish three things.
The first is the removal of the DC-DC converter to shave off a few parts and lower the part cost.
The second goal is to add a third battery to enable the use of blue and white (and blue derivatives like pink and purple) LEDs.
The third goal is to use 5mm LEDs instead of surface mount.  This has the benefit of being cheaper, as well as much easier to find various colors.  Also, the 5mm LEDs are larger, so the gaps between LEDs will be nearly non-existent.

Finally, all of the above modifications (and any others that are thought up along the way) must be done in a way that will not change the AVR's wiring.
