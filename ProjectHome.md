# Introduction #
Bicycle LED POV is an electronic LED bar to attach on bicycle wheels. When riding the bicycle, the LED bar will draw with light, text messages and image animations.

Custom text messages and animations will be drawn on a PC software and downloaded using an USB cable.

# Goals of the project #
  * create a Free/Open hardware, firmware and software LED POV for bicycle wheels;
  * easy to use for non electronics technician people;
  * find some company that wants to sell PCBs, kits or final assembled product;
  * [use only Free Software tools as possible, like CAD software for PCB design, C compiler for MCU firmware, etc](ToOls.md);
  * open to improvements and new ideas from community.

# Your participation #
Because hacking is fun and projects are like life, always evolving, If you have any ideas, If you think you can improve the project, If you want to say something, please leave a message on the [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/bicycleledpov).
This project is a work in progress, It's an effort to improve actual bicycle LED POVs as the [SpokePOV](http://ladyada.net/make/spokepov/index.html) from Ladyada. There is room for a lot of improvements as the project involves different areas as:
  * mechanics;
  * electronics;
  * software;
  * [LED art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_Art);
  * [animations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation);
  * [demos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demo_(computer_programming)).

# Current status #
We are working on V2. We are working on schematic and PCB, you can find them on [SVN trunk](http://code.google.com/p/bicycleledpov/source/checkout).

We plan to sell the Bicycle LED POV online, to worldwide, on July 2010. We will sell it on kit or full assembled.
