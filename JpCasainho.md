My name is Jorge Pinto, I am from Portugal and I have 29 years old. I initiated Bicycle LED POV project on May 2008.

I work on a [company](http://www.plurirede.pt/) doing electronics circuits with LEDs for automotive.
On my day-to-day work I mainly program Atmel AVR 8 bits microcontrollers.

I have a few bikes and I usually go to work using bike + train. I am also involved on [my country Critical Mass](http://massacriticapt.net/) site.

I like arts, sports and green environment, I do really like music, video and dance.
